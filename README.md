# DOCUMENTATION ON THREE-TIER ARCHITECTURE 
# LOGIN PAGE

# Introduction :
This project demonstrates the development of a web-based application featuring a login system with a subsequent dashboard using the three-tier architecture. Our goal is to construct a secure and intuitive platform where users can authenticate themselves and access personalized content through a centralized dashboard.

The three-tier architecture, comprising the presentation layer, application layer, and data layer, serves as the backbone of our application's design. The presentation layer encompasses user interface elements such as login forms and dashboards, while the application layer houses the business logic for user authentication and content delivery. The data layer manages the storage and retrieval of user credentials and dashboard data, ensuring robustness, security, and scalability.

This implementation leverages Eclipse as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE), with key files including index.jsp, verification.jsp, and dashboard.jsp. In verification.jsp, database details are configured, specifying the AWS instance where MySQL is hosted, along with the requisite user and database settings.

The build process involves Maven, which generates a WAR (Web Application Archive) file upon compilation. This WAR file encapsulates the entire project, including necessary dependencies and configurations. Subsequently, the WAR file is deployed to a Tomcat server for hosting and execution.

Through this project, we aim to exemplify the practical application of three-tier architecture in web development, emphasizing modularity, scalability, and maintainability. By following this architectural pattern, we ensure a structure d and extensible solution capable of meeting evolving requirements and accommodating future enhancements.

1. Login:
This is likely the root directory of your project.

2. src/main/resources: 
This directory typically holds non-Java resources used by your application, such as configuration files, property files, or static resources.

3. JRE System Library [JavaSE-1.8]: 
This represents the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) System Library, containing essential Java runtime classes. It's automatically included in your Java project by your IDE.

4. Maven Dependencies: 
This directory contains all the dependencies managed by Maven for your project. Each JAR file represents a library required by your project, such as the servlet API (javax.servlet-api-3.1.0.jar), MySQL JDBC driver (mysql-connector-java-8.0.33.jar), and others. It's typical to see multiple JAR files listed under Maven Dependencies.

5. src/main/webapp:
This directory contains your web application's resources, including JSP files (index.jsp, verification.jsp, dashboard.jsp, dashboard2.jsp), as well as the WEB-INF/ directory. The WEB-INF/ directory typically contains configuration files specific to your web application, such as web.xml.

6. target/Login:
This directory seems to represent the output directory where the compiled files are generated. It includes the src/ directory, which might be a duplication.

7. target/m2e-wtp: 
This directory might be related to the Maven Eclipse Plugin (m2e-wtp), which helps with deploying Maven projects to Eclipse's WTP (Web Tools Platform). It includes the maven-archiver/ directory, which contains the WAR file (Login.war) generated by Maven. The pom.xml file is also included here, which is the Maven project configuration file.

8. Servers/Tomcat v8.5 Server at localhost-config: 
This directory seems to contain configuration files related to the Tomcat v8.5 Server configured on your local machine. It's likely managed by your IDE (e.g., Eclipse) to handle server configurations.

# Data Configuration:

1. EC2 instance setup:
* Launch an EC2 instance with the desired specifications (e.g., instance type, operating system).
* Ensure that the security group associated with the instance allows inbound connections on the MySQL port (default is 3306) from the necessary IP addresses or ranges.

2. MySQL Installation:
* Connect to your EC2 instance using SSH.
* Update the package repository: `sudo yum update`.
* Install MySQL server:
 `sudo rpm --import https://repo.mysql.com/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql-2022`
 `wget http://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql57-community-release-el7-8.noarch.rpm`
 `sudo yum localinstall -y mysql57-community-release-el7-8.noarch.rpm`
 `sudo yum install -y mysql-community-server`
* Start the MySQL service and enable it to start on boot:
 `sudo systemctl start mysqld`
 `sudo systemctl enable mysqld`

3. MySQL Configuration:
* Retrieve the root password:
  `sudo grep 'temporary password' /var/log/mysqld.log`
* Log in to MYSQL:
 `mysql -u root -p`
* Change the root password:
  `ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'MyNewPass1!';`
* Create a new database for your application:
  `CREATE DATABASE loginapp;`
  ` USE loginapp;`
* Create tables:
  `CREATE TABLE login (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
    );`
  ` CREATE TABLE user (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    password VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
    );`
* Insert data into the created tables:
  `INSERT INTO login (username, password)
   VALUES ('meghana', 'meghana123');`
  `INSERT INTO users (username, password)
   VALUES ('localhost', 'Localhost@123');`

4. User Setup:
* Create a new MySQL user and grant appropriate privileges on the database
  ` CREATE USER 'db_user'@'44.222.220.136' IDENTIFIED BY 'Apple@3005';
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON loginapp.* TO 'db_user'@'44.222.220.136';
    FLUSH PRIVILEGES;`
